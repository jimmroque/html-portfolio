<h1>About Jimuell</h1>
<p>I was born in the Philippines and moved to Canada at the age of 14 in July 2014. After completing my education at
  New Westminster Secondary School, I began my career as a chef, honing my skills in the culinary arts. Over time, 
  I transitioned into the healthcare field, becoming a licensed optician and contact lens fitter. </p>

<p>Now, I'm embarking on a new journey, exploring the world of web development—a passion I discovered early in life but temporarily set aside while pursuing other career paths.
  Coding has always held a special place in my heart, and I’m excited to return to it, eager to combine my diverse experiences with my love for technology.</p>
